# My Neovim Config

Based on the [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) config.
Modified with some extra spice for ts development.

Some weird things I do:
I am  using [coc.nvim] just for the spell check, I couldn't find another spell check that met my needs.
I have bound fixing spelling errors to leader cw (I like that it seems like i am changing the word)
